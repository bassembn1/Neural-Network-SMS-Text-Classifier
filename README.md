# Neural-Network-SMS-Text-Classifier
This project classifies SMS messages as spam or ham using a neural network. It loads the dataset, cleans and encodes the text, then trains a TensorFlow model to predict the message type. The goal is to learn basic natural language processing and build an AI model that detects unwanted spam messages.
